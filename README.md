Atrium

Atrium is a platform designed to make student organization meetings more engaging for both members and organizers. It helps clubs run live meetings with seamless attendance tracking and member organization, while also giving students a better way to connect and stay involved. Instead of juggling QR codes, Google Forms, and links flashed on a projector, Atrium lets attendees check in, connect with others via LinkedIn, and access shared resources in real time.


How to Run:

- Visit https://www.atrium.ink/
- Sign up with LinkedIn SSO
- For organizers: Create an organization profile and start your first live event.
- For club event attendees: Join a live event through the QR code or 6 digit code provided by the organizer.
